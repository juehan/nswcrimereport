				<p class="big">
					This website is to deploy my toy application to display NSW,
					Australia crime news reported by NSW Police.
					As a children-grower and family keeper myself living in NSW, Australia,
					I'm sure being aware of crime risk around and keep those thing happening from my family should always be number one priority.
				</p>
				<p class="big">
					Current crime report system delivered by NSW police is well and good as they are proactive to share their information through many social networking platforms, just name a few, Twitter, Facebook and RSS.
				</p>
				<p class="big">
					Being said that, my gut feeling is it would be much better to map those information in something more eye-friendly way as well as visually enhanced space.

					I believe Google Maps, at the moment, is the best way where I can deliver these information more effectively and efficiently.
					This is where this web application came from.

					<em class="normal">Technical components</em>
				</p>
				<p class="big">
					This web application is mainly developed utilizing Google Maps API v3, Python and its open source libraries
					such as geopy, BeautifulSoup and some Java-script, HTML of course.
				</p>
				<p class="big">
					<em class="normal">Deploy environment</em>
				</p>
				<p class="big">
					Google maps mapped NSW crime news information will be updated as per every hour unless there are any issues with the
					hosting company, potential bugs and whatever changes.
					It's accessible through <a href="http://nswcrime.alwaysdata.net/crimewatch/crimenews.html">this link</a> thanks to 
					wonderful free web hosting company, <a href="http://www.alwaysdata.net">alwaysdata</a>.

This is the application to display NSW, Australia crime news reported by NSW Police. 

Current crime report system delivered by NSW police is well and good as they are proactive to share their information through many social networking platforms, just name a few, Twitter, Facebook and RSS.

Said that, it would be much better to map those information in something more eye-friendly way as well as in visually enhanced space. I believe Google Maps, at the moment, is one of best way where we can deliver these information more effectively. 

This is where this web application came from.


Technical components

This web application is mainly developed utilizing Google Maps API, Python and its open source libraries such as geopy, BeautifulSoup. Of course as this is web application, I used some javascript, HTML.


Deploy environment

Google maps mapped NSW crime news information will be updated as per every hour unless there are any issues with the hosting company, potential bugs and whatever changes. It's accessible through this link thanks to wonderful free web hosting company, alwaysdata.

Please be aware that this service may suspend at any time if NSW police decides to block its use or change the way of their news updates.
